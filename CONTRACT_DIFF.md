# Contract Diff Proposals

Date: 2026-02-01

## Proposed clarifications (PRD alignment)

- **Payload ciphertext size cap**: enforce a maximum decoded ciphertext size of **64 KiB** (`ciphertext_b64` decoded bytes) for all payload envelopes.
- **Offer `request_schema_hint` size cap**: enforce a maximum UTF-8 byte length of **4096 bytes**.
- **Canonical RFC3339 UTC timestamps**: require client-supplied timestamp strings to be canonical `RFC3339Nano` (UTC `Z`, no trailing zeros in fractional seconds). Relay emits canonical timestamps and rejects non-canonical inputs (e.g., `...43.340Z`).

## Operational posture notes (non-contract endpoints)

- **Health endpoints**: `/healthz` and `/readyz` are localhost-only by default; can be made public for dev via `NBR_HEALTH_PUBLIC=true`.
- **Metrics exposure**: optional separate metrics listener via `NBR_METRICS_ADDR` (localhost recommended).
